Practicals for VHDL for FPGAs training course

These are practicals for use in the VHDL for FPGAs training course. Currently they won't really make sense without the actual training material, which is not published.

These practicals are targeted at the BASYS3 dev board : https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-54wqge.html.

## Philosophy of the course

This course specifically aims to teach VHDL for FPGA development, not just VHDL as a language, as is the case with much presently available training material. We aim to teach some basic digital electronics, the workings of an FPGA (Xilinx 7 series specifically) and the art of FPGA development, in addition to the language of VHDL.

A key tenet of the course is 'learning by doing', hence the practicals found here. Each practical is a minimal example of an FPGA or VHDL feature. Often there are multiple implementations, or variations, of each exercise that explore the feature in more detail. The practicals on their own will not teach you anything. They are written to accompany a taught course.

## Practicals

The source for each practical is pretty much self contained, with some minor exceptions. Most practicals use Basys-3-Master.xdc which is in the common folder.
