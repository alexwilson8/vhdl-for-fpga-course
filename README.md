Practicals for VHDL for FPGAs training course

These are practicals for use in the VHDL for FPGAs training couse. Currently they won't really make sence without the actual training material, which is not yet published. Perhaps soon...

These practicals are targetted at the BASYS3 dev board : https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-54wqge.html.

## Philosophy of the course

This course specifically aims to teach VHDL for FPGA development, not just VHDL as a language, as is the case with much presently availbale training material. We aim to teach some basic digital electronics, the workings of an FPGA (Xilinx 7 series specifically) and the art of FPGA development, in addition to the language of VHDL.

A key tenet of the course is 'learning by doing', hence the practicals found here. Each practical is a minimal example of an FPGA or VHDL feature. Often there are multiple implemnetations, or variations, of each exercise that explore the feaure in more detail. The pracicals on their own will not teach you anything. They are writtent to accompany a taught course.

## Practicals

Below is a summary of the aims of each practical:
